# When We Disconnect from Other Peopleâ€™s Emotions
*How emotional chaos in early life shuts down empathy as a survival response.*

---

Children are born wired to connect.  
To feel what others feel.  
To care.  
To reach for warmth and retreat from threat.

But when the emotional environment is volatileâ€”  
when caregivers are unpredictable, irrational, or unsafeâ€”  
the childâ€™s nervous system starts shutting things down.

> Not because the child is cold.  
> Because their body canâ€™t keep feeling everything and survive.

This is how we begin to **disconnect from other peopleâ€™s emotions.**  
Not because we lack empathy,  
but because empathy became *too painful to carry.*

## What Causes This Disconnection

- Being punished for noticing or naming adultsâ€™ emotional states  
- Feeling responsible for calming or fixing a parentâ€™s anger, sadness, or fear  
- Never being allowed to express emotions safely without being mocked or shamed  

Eventually, the childâ€™s system says:

> "Feeling what others feel is dangerous."

So it turns it off.  
Or it narrows it.  
Or it uses that perception only when itâ€™s useful to stay safe or in control.

## What This Looks Like Later in Life

- You can tell what others feelâ€”but you donâ€™t feel it with them  
- You use emotional awareness to manage situationsâ€”not to connect  
- You view othersâ€™ pain as weakness, manipulation, or a burden  

This is how the early **empathy system becomes distorted.**  
It doesnâ€™t disappearâ€”it becomes **strategic.**

And once this happens long enough, **Manipulative Mode** can beginâ€”  
not out of cruelty, but from a nervous system that never got to feel safe while caring.
