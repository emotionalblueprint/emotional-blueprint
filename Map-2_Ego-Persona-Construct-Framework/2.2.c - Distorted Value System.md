# 🧠 Being Raised Around Adults with a Distorted Value System  
*When what they preach doesn’t match how they live.*

---

Some of the deepest emotional confusion begins when the people raising us  
**say the right things—but live the opposite.**

They teach values like:  
> “Kindness matters.”  
> “Always tell the truth.”  
> “Treat others how you want to be treated.”

But then they:

- Yell, mock, or belittle behind closed doors  
- Lie when it’s convenient  
- Justify cruelty as discipline  

This creates **moral incoherence** in the child—  
a split between what’s said and what’s done.

The child can’t reconcile it, so they begin to copy the performance:

> Say the right thing.  
> Do what keeps you safe.  
> Hide the rest.

## 🧠 What the Child Learns

- *Words are more important than actions.*  
- *Appearances matter more than emotional truth.*  
- *Power makes you right—even when you’re wrong.*

Over time, the child may stop trusting their own sense of right and wrong.  
They may become hyper-logical, disconnected from emotional integrity.  
Or they may begin to **use values as tools**—to perform goodness while still protecting control.

This is how distorted value systems replicate:  
**Not by teaching cruelty directly, but by modeling hypocrisy as normal.**

## 🩶 The Long-Term Impact

- A performative moral identity (*being good = being liked*)  
- Manipulating others while appearing emotionally aware  
- Deep fear of being exposed as “not good enough”  
- Difficulty owning harm or taking responsibility
