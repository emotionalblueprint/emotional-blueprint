## üõ°Ô∏è The Emotional Armor We Learn to Wear

When emotional safety is missing, children build a false version of themselves to survive.

This map traces the formation of that **False Self**‚Äî  
a mask shaped by fear, rejection, and unmet needs‚Äî  
and shows how it becomes a prison that keeps us from real connection.

You‚Äôll trace the full arc:

1. **How our caregivers shape our emotional identity**  
2. **What wounds distort the real self**  
3. **How the ego becomes our survival mask**  
4. **What it costs us‚Äîand how we heal**
