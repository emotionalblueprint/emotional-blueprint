### ✨ TEG-Blue’s Real Intention
1. **Democratise Nervous-System Literacy**  
   If you can read a traffic-light, you can read the Compass. No psych degree, no $200 therapy session required.

2. **Collapse the Paywall Around Mental-Health Insight**  
   Every framework, scale and quiz is CC-BY-NC-SA. Print it, screenshot it, translate it—money should never gatekeep clarity.

3. **Turn “Mental-Health Care” into a Shared Evolution Trait**  
   We treat hygiene and first-aid as common knowledge; emotional regulation should be the same. TEG-Blue is the pocket first-aid kit for the nervous system.

4. **Bridge Street Wisdom and Academic Rigor**  
   Colour gradients and plain language on the front; citations and nested theory on the back. Anyone can skim, researchers can dig.

5. **Plug-and-Play With Whatever Help You Already Have**  
   Therapy, coaching, community groups—TEG-Blue simply gives you the map so every other modality lands faster and costs less.

### The End-Goal
A world where a 13-year-old, a factory supervisor, and a clinical psychologist can point at the same colour band and say,  
“Ah—Amber Defense. Let’s breathe, boundary, and move back to Teal.”

No elite gateway, no secret handshake—just shared, humane technology for the nervous system.
