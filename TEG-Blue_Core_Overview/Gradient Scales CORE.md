Absolutely—we’ll refresh every scale so they:

1. Anchor visually to the four-colour Compass header (Belonging → Defense → Manipulation → Tyranny).  
2. Keep their original micro-tiers but use the revised wording + colour swatches.  
3. Fit one consistent, copy-and-paste template, making future updates painless.

Below is the plan plus a sample rewrite you can approve before we batch-convert the rest.

## Step-by-Step Rewrite Plan

| Day | Task | Output |
|-----|------|--------|
| 1 | Lock template language & layout (header, tier block, call-outs). | Approved master Figma / Canva page. |
| 2 | Rewrite 1–2 flagship scales (e.g., Accountability, Control) for tone & flow; get your sign-off. | Final PDFs + copy. |
| 3 | Batch-convert remaining 7 scales using the template. | Draft PDFs + docx files. |
| 4 | Accessibility sweep (alt-text, large-print, colour-contrast). | Universal version set. |
| 5 | “Release bundle” ZIP + Gumroad upload + open-template folder. | Ready for public + funder links. |

## Sample Rewrite – Accountability Gradient (condensed)

```
━━━━━━━━ FULL GRADIENT COMPASS ━━━━━━━━
Belonging | Defense | Manipulation | Tyranny
TEAL        AMBER      RED           BLACK

Accountability Gradient · The Gradient Scales
------------------------------------------------
TEAL — Real Accountability
  • Owns impact without prompting
  • Action-based repair follows words

AMBER — Defensive Accountability
  • Apology arrives only after pressure
  • Focus on image, not impact

RED — Manipulative Accountability
  • “I’m the worst” martyr lines flip blame
  • Behaviour repeats; guilt is the leash

BLACK — Abusive Non-Accountability
  • Denies obvious harm, punishes you for naming it
  • Retaliates when held to any standard

COMMON-SENSE BLOCK
Real care stays when the guilt storm passes; control disappears once it wins silence.

Micro-action:
If stuck at AMBER for 3+ incidents, request specific repair steps.  
If RED appears, pause contact until steps are met.  
BLACK → disengage & seek support.

### Your Quick Decisions

1. **Template language OK?** Any words you’d tweak before we scale it?  
2. **Which two flagship scales first?** (Default: Accountability & Control).  
3. **Any brand tone notes?** (e.g., keep “Common-Sense Block” name or rename).
