## Core Concepts in TEG-Blue  
_The indispensable ideas that weave together all eight frameworks & the Gradient Scales._

### 🌈 The Full Gradient Compass  
A four-colour navigation bar—Teal → Amber → Red → Black—that tracks every shift from  
• **Belonging** (safe connection)  (Self-Aware, and self-reflect)
• **Defense** (self-protection)  (Not self-aware, can self-reflect)
• **Manipulation** (control through emotion)  (Not always self-aware of the harm they do, can not self-reflect)
• **Tyranny** (harm through domination)  (Self-Aware, can't self-reflect)
One glance tells you *where you are, where they are,* and which tool to grab next.

### 🔌 The Emotional Circuit Board  
Emotion is circuitry, not mystery. Three live components fire in milliseconds:  
1. **Inner Compass** – body’s safety readout  
2. **Empathy Sensor** – how we interpret others  
3. **Behavior Mode** – protect or connect output  
Mis-calibrate one node and the whole board skews—panic looks like passion, control poses as care.

### 🌀 Mode-Dependent Emotion  
Feelings aren’t fixed; they **re-code themselves through mode**:  
• Anger in Belonging = boundary clarity.  
• Anger in Defense = threat reflex.  
• Anger in Manipulation = leverage.  
Label the mode first, the emotion second—that’s emotional literacy 2.0.

### 🪶 The Ego Persona Stack  
Three survival layers form over time:  
1. **Real Self** – raw, felt truth  
2. **Logic Layer** – rules we invent to stay safe  
3. **Role Mask** – the performance that wins approval  
TEG-Blue shows how to loosen the mask without ripping away the protection underneath.

### ⚖️ Intent & Impact Gradient  
Harm lives on a spectrum: unconscious hurt ▸ defensive distortion ▸ calculated manipulation ▸ tyrannical abuse.  
The model makes **intent visible** so you stop confusing clumsy survival with coercive control.

---

### 🧬 Neurodivergence as Evolution  
Divergent brains aren’t broken—they run wider pattern bandwidth and deeper emotional sensors.  
Instead of forcing masks, TEG-Blue designs systems that let these rhythms upgrade the collective map.

---

### 🪢 Generational Bridgework  
Emotional wounds are inherited algorithms. The framework supplies scripts to honour context **without excusing impact**, so cycles stop with us—not our children.

---

### 🏛️ Breaking False Social Models  
Power ≠ control, obedience ≠ virtue, gender ≠ destiny, burnout ≠ success.  
By mapping how culture keeps bodies in chronic Defense Mode, TEG-Blue turns personal healing into social redesign.

---

### 🛠️ The Gradient Scales Library  
Ten colour-keyed scales (Accountability, Control, Empathy, etc.) + Reality Check-ins turn gut    hunches into **visual data in under 2 minutes**.  
They’re not for perfection; they’re GPS pings that keep you oriented when emotions fog.

### 🚀 Outcome  
TEG-Blue doesn’t promise a calmer life; it delivers a **clearer one**.  
You become the person who can:  
• Feel everything without weaponising anything.  
• Hold power without slipping into control.  
• Pass on nervous-system safety instead of nervous-system trauma.
