#  The Self — Who We Really Are Before Survival Took Over  
*You were never broken—only buried beneath protection.*

---

## 🌱 You Were Born Whole

Before anyone told you how to act—  
before fear entered your system—  
before love had conditions—  
you were simply **you**.

Alive in your body.  
Responsive to emotion.  
Open to connection.

This is what we call **The Self**—  
the part of you that existed before performance.  
The one that didn’t ask, “Am I too much?”  
because it hadn’t been told it was.

## 🧠 The Self Is Not a Thought

You don’t think your way into your Self.  
You **feel** your way into it.

The Self is:  
- Emotional, not logical  
- Present, not performative  
- Fluid, not fixed

It’s the part of you that says:  
> “I feel scared.”  
> “I need closeness.”  
> “I want to explore.”  
> “I don’t understand.”

It’s not polished.  
It’s not polite.  
But it’s **honest**.

## 🧊 What Froze the Self

For many of us, this original Self didn’t last long.

When your joy was too loud…  
When your tears made someone uncomfortable…  
When your curiosity was seen as rebellion…  
Your Self became **a problem**.

So your nervous system adapted.  
It **muted**.  
It **narrated**.  
It **masked**.

But the Self never disappeared.  
It just got **buried beneath the layers**.

## 🧭 What This Page Teaches

You weren’t born a mask.  
You became one—for protection.

You weren’t born disembodied.  
You disconnected—to survive.

The Self is still there—  
underneath the logic, underneath the mask.

Not something you create.  
Something you **come back to**.
