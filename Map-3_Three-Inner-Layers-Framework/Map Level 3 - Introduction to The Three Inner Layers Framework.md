# 🪞 The Three Inner Layers Framework  
*The Self, The Logic, and The Mask*

---

## 🧠 How the Self Splits to Survive

We’re not born with masks. We build them.  
When our emotional world is not seen or welcomed, we begin splitting into **three core layers**:

- The **true self** we are
- The **logic layer** that protects us
- The **mask** we wear to stay safe

This map traces how those three layers form, why they matter, and how to begin returning to who you really are—beneath the logic and the mask.

You’ll learn:

1. **How emotional survival distorts our identity**  
2. **Why the logic layer defends the false self**  
3. **How to reconnect with your real self beneath it all**

# 🚪 The Three Inner Layers Framework  
### *How we split from who we are—and how we come home again*

## 🌿 Grounding in What Was Lost

### [[3.1 - The Real Self Before the Split]]
_You began whole._  
The part of you that felt, played, cried, and asked for love—before survival taught you to hide.

---

## 🛡️ How We Learned to Survive

### [[3.2 - The Logic — The Rules We Built to Feel Safe]]
When life stopped making sense, we made rules to survive. This page explores how the Logic Layer forms to protect us from emotional chaos.

###  [[3.3 - The Mask — The Performance That Protects Us]]
The Role Mask forms to keep us accepted, safe, or praised. But over time, it becomes a trap.

---

## 🧨 When the Split Becomes Our Identity

### [[3.4 - When the Mask Becomes the Identity]]
The performance starts to feel like the person. You forget who you were underneath.

### [[3.5 - The Self — Who We Really Are Before Survival Took Over]]
Even if it’s buried, the Real Self never disappeared. This page begins the return.

---

## ⚔️ The Internal Conflict

### [[3.6 - The War Between the Layers — Inner Conflict & Collapse]]
When Logic, Mask, and Real Self are in conflict, we feel anxious, confused, and emotionally stuck.

---

## 🌈 Returning Home

### [[3.7 - Healing the Split — Coming Back to the Real Self]]
Healing isn’t about erasing the mask. It’s about listening for the voice that was buried beneath it.

> This framework helps you name your **inner structure**: the self you were, the mask you perform, and the logic that tries to keep it all together.
> 
> And it shows you the way back—to the **soft, unmasked, emotionally alive self** who was never truly lost.
