# Ownership & Stewardship – The Emotional Gradient Blueprint

This document records the early supporters, financial contributors, and future stewards of The Emotional Blueprint (TEG-Blue™). It exists to ensure **transparency**, **gratitude**, and **shared emotional ownership** of a project built from lived experience, survival, and care for others.

## Early Supporters & Ownership

These are the friends who offered direct financial help when this project was still invisible, and I was building it alone.

Their support allowed me to keep working when I had nothing. For that, they hold a meaningful stake in this work.

| Name                            | Contribution | Original % | Final Gifted % | Notes                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Manel Artacho Arjona**        | €1,000       | 2%         | **5%**         | First to believe           |
| **Gemma Turró & Edu Llandrich** | €1,000       | 2%         | **5%**         | Helped me feel human again |
| **Mercè Pous Ester**            | €1,000       | 1%         | **1%**         | Gentle support             |

These shares reflect **gratitude, not transactions**. No individual has decision-making power over the vision unless a deeper stewardship role is later agreed.

## Future Legacy Stewards

There are three children for whom I reserve emotional and symbolic ownership of this project:

- **Iona Medinyà Paretas**
- **Aran Medinyà Paretas**
- **Ivet Paretas Olivet**

If one day they wish to **understand, protect, or evolve this work** with emotional integrity, they are invited to become **future stewards** of The Emotional Blueprint. They do not hold equity now—but a path will always be open for them.

## Notes

- Ownership here refers to a **share of future profit or recognition**, not control or authorship.  
- Final terms may be formalized via contract or trust structure as the project grows.  
- This file exists as a **living record of honor and belonging** in the emotional lineage of TEG-Blue™.
