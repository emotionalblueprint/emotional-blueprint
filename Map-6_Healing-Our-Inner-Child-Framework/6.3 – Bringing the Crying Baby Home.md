_A somatic practice of healing: imagining your younger self, holding them, and ending the story of guilt and rejection._

---

There is a part of you that never stopped crying.  
Not out loud. But deep inside—  
quietly, constantly.

The part of you that felt abandoned.  
That didn’t understand why love came with punishment.  
Why silence followed every emotional need.  
Why tenderness always seemed to cost you something.

When no one comes to help, the child blames themselves.  
> “I must be bad.”  
> “I must have done something wrong.”

And that belief becomes the seed of the false self.

We grow up.  
But the crying baby doesn’t disappear.  
They just hide—  
deep in the nervous system,  
waiting for someone to come get them.

That someone is you.

This is the moment you go back.  
Not as a thought.  
But as a presence.

You close your eyes.  
You see them. Not as a concept—  
but as a real, living child.  
Crying. Confused. Longing to be held.

And you walk toward them.  
You pick them up.  
You hold them close.  
You say:

> *“You didn’t do anything wrong.”*  
> *“I know you’ve been alone for a long time.”*  
> *“I’m here now. And I’m not leaving.”*

This is how the nervous system begins to heal.  
Not through perfection—  
but through presence.

You don’t need to fix everything.  
You just need to stay.

Stay with the one who was left.  
Be what no one was for you.

Because this is not fantasy.  
It’s emotional truth.  
That part of you still lives in your body.  
And your presence can rewrite the story.

You are no longer the abandoned one.  
You are the one who came back.

> *You’re loved. You’re valued. You’re worthy. You’re enough.*
