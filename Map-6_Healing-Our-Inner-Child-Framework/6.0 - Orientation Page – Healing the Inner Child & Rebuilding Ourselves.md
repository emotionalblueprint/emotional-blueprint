_Overview of Map 6 and what it helps you reclaim._

## 🌱 Why This Map Exists

Before you learned to mask, control, or perform—  
you were someone.

That someone—your emotional self—was born with needs, clarity, and the ability to connect.  
But when care, protection, or truth were denied,  
you had to adapt to survive.

That adaptation became your role.  
Your image.  
Your mask.  
Your False Self.

Map 6 is about **reclaiming the real you**—  
and healing the pain that made you abandon yourself in the first place.

## 🧠 Who This Map Is For

If you feel like you lost yourself trying to be who others needed—this map is for you.  
If you’ve done the work but still carry shame for your needs—or guilt for your anger—this map is for you.  
If you want to build love that feels **safe, not performative**—this map is for you.

## 🛤️ What Comes Next

You’ll move through four emotional arcs:

1. **What Happened to You** — understanding the wound  
2. **Repairing the Compass** — restoring pride, clarity, and truth  
3. **Rebuilding Relationships** — setting boundaries with love  
4. **Integration & Community Repair** — breaking cycles for good

This is not self-help.  
It’s **self-return**.

You are not a project to fix.  
You are a person to come home to.
