# TEG-Code

**TEG-Code** is the machine-readable emotional logic layer of *The Emotional Gradient Blueprint (TEG-Blue)*.

It translates complex emotional behaviors, survival responses, and repair cues into structured data that can be understood by machines, researchers, and emotionally aware systems.

## What It Does

TEG-Code provides:

- A growing collection of **emotionally-coded cards** describing real-life emotional behaviors and relational dynamics
- An open schema using **JSON-LD** and **RDF-style definitions**
- Tools for AI developers, therapists, and safety researchers to **analyze, query, and integrate emotional intelligence**

## Card Structure

Each card includes:

- **Color Zone** – Regulation state (green = repair, orange = defense, red = manipulation)
- **Intent** – Emotional or relational intent behind the behavior
- **Pattern Type** – Tactic, survival response, or repair cue
- **Example Text** – A real-world sentence or gesture showing the behavior
- **Relational Impact** – How it typically affects trust, clarity, and connection
- **Card Group** – The emotional system cluster it belongs to

## Why This Matters

Emotional intelligence in tech is still shallow.  
TEG-Code brings **depth, nuance, and safety** to how we represent emotion in data systems.

## Status

This is version 1. The structure and examples will grow.  
Future updates will include interactive prototypes, visual annotations, and real-world case tagging.
