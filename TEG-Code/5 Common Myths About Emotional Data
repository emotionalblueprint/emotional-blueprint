5 Common Myths About Emotional Data

A quick breakdown of how most systems misunderstand emotion—and what TEG-Code offers instead.

❌ The Myth	⚠️ Why It’s Harmful	✅ TEG-Code’s Response
Emotions can be fully quantified	Reduces rich emotional states to numbers or scores—ignoring story, intent, and relational meaning.	Maps emotion as logic, not just data. Emotions are patterns, not metrics.
One universal model fits all	Erases cultural, neurodivergent, and trauma-based differences in emotional expression.	Builds flexibility into the model. Emotion = context × history × intent.
Emotional data is objective	Hides bias in labeling, power in framing, and context in meaning.	Makes emotional logic transparent. Shows behavior, impact, and motive—side by side.
Emotion is the opposite of logic	Devalues emotional reasoning, especially in survival or relational stress.	Frames emotion as structured logic. Defense and belonging are emotional algorithms.
Emotion models are only for therapy or AI	Excludes emotional awareness from systems that need it—like education, justice, or leadership.	Designs for systems, not silos. Emotional safety is a foundation for all human systems.
