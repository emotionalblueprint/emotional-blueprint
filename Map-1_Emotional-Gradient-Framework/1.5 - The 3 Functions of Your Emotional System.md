x#### _Understanding how emotions work inside us—and between us_

## 🔄 Your Emotional System Is Always Working

Your emotional system isn’t just something you **feel**.  
It’s something you **use**—whether you realize it or not.

It does three things, constantly:

1. It helps you understand **yourself**  
2. It helps you read **others**
3. It helps you act depending of what is going on

This is how your emotions become your navigation system.  
They guide your choices, your relationships, your sense of what’s real, your actions.

## 🧩 1. Your Internal Compass  
_The emotions you feel inside_

This is the system that tells you:

- What’s safe  
- What matters  
- What you need

You feel sadness. Fear. Connection. Joy.  
Each one is a signal. A message from within.

> It’s not about controlling what you feel.  
> It’s about learning to listen—so you can follow what’s true.

When your compass is steady, you trust yourself.  
When it’s disrupted—by trauma, emotional chaos, or dismissal—  
you start to doubt what you feel. The compass begins to spin.

That’s when your system shifts into **Defense Mode**—the protective state we explored earlier.
And **Belonging Mode** becomes harder to reach.

## 🌐 2. Your Empathy Sensors  
_The emotions you pick up from others_

You don’t just feel your own emotions—  
you **perceive** the emotional signals around you.

- You hear tension in someone’s voice.  
- You feel joy in a friend’s laugh.  
- You sense when something’s off—even if no one says a word.

This is your **Empathy Sensor**.  
It helps you tune into others emotionally.

But like any sensor, it can be:

- **Overloaded** → You feel everything  
- **Blocked** → You feel nothing  
- **Distorted** → You misread what you feel

When the sensor is off, connection becomes confusing.  
You might take on other people’s emotions—or miss them completely.

## 🧬 What Shapes Our Internal Compass and Empathy Sensors?

These systems are **shaped in context**, influenced by:

- The home you grew up in  
- The emotional safety (or chaos) around you  
- Past trauma  
- How caregivers responded to emotions  
- Your genetics and nervous system sensitivity

If your system is off-track, it’s **not your fault**.  
It means your body adapted to survive.

## 🤝 When Both Systems Work Together

> Your **Internal Compass** tells you how you feel.  
> Your **Empathy Sensor** helps you read others.

Together, they form the foundation of **emotional intelligence**.  
They help you stay grounded in yourself *and* connected to others.

Without them, it’s hard to know what’s real—  
inside you, or between you and someone else.

Learning how they work is the start of rebuilding **emotional trust**:  
in your body, your boundaries, and your relationships.
