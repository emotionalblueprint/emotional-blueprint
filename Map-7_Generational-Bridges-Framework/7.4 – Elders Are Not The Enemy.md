When a culture is emotionally disconnected, it often turns elders into scapegoats.  
They are blamed for the world’s pain, mocked for their age, and dismissed as “the problem.”

But this reaction says more about us than it does about them.

When we have no healthy models of elderhood—no wise guides, no emotionally grounded leaders—we begin to associate aging with decay, detachment, and control.  
We forget that true elders are not power-hungry.  
They are power-aware.

We need to separate **toxic elders** from **true elders**.  
Just as not all parents are safe, not all elders are emotionally mature.

But the solution is not to reject aging—it’s to **reclaim elderhood** as something sacred and earned.

A true elder protects the young.  
They don’t compete with them.  
They teach from experience, not ego.  
They hold power with humility, not control.

If we want to break the cycle of generational harm, we must stop seeing elders as enemies—and start becoming the kind we never had.

Not perfect.  
Not all-knowing.  
But safe enough to tell the truth, and strong enough to protect what matters.

This page is a bridge.  
Between memory and future.  
Between who hurt us—and who we choose to become.
