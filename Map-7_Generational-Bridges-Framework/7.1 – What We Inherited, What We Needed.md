We all grow up inside stories we didn’t choose. Roles that were handed to us. Emotions we were told to swallow. Versions of love that felt like control, absence, or shame. Many of us entered adulthood not knowing what safety, respect, or care were supposed to feel like. We just knew what it felt like to go without them.

The truth is, most parents weren’t given what they needed either. They raised children while carrying unprocessed grief, fear, and emotional hunger of their own. What they passed down wasn’t always love—it was survival. Their silence, their anger, their control—all of it was shaped by a system that didn’t teach them how to repair.

This doesn’t mean the harm wasn’t real. It means the harm was *repeated*.

Emotional inheritance isn’t just trauma—it’s everything we absorbed in order to stay connected: how we express need, how we respond to conflict, how we see ourselves and others. And often, we inherited the very patterns that made us feel small.

We learned to disconnect from ourselves to be accepted. We became the child our caregivers needed us to be, instead of the child we were. We took on guilt that wasn’t ours. We confused fear with love. We normalized distance and thought it was maturity.

To break this cycle, we first have to name what we inherited. Not to blame, but to see. Not to punish, but to understand. Because only then can we begin to give ourselves what was missing.

This is the beginning of the bridge: seeing clearly, and choosing not to pass it on.
