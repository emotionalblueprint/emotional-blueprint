Legacy isn’t what we build.  
It’s what we pass on.

Not in money.  
Not in achievements.  
But in emotion. In presence. In how we made others feel.

Did we silence or listen?  
Control or empower?  
Dismiss or believe?

Most of us grew up carrying the weight of unfinished stories.  
Pain that was never named.  
Needs that were never met.  
Love that was confused with fear.

But it doesn’t have to end that way.

We can choose to leave behind something else:  
**The story of how it changed with us.**  
Of how we faced what others denied.  
Of how we broke the pattern—not with violence, but with vision.

The world we create—  
in our homes, our words, our relationships—  
that is the legacy.

One that says:  
“I didn’t pass on what broke me.  
I passed on what healed me.”

And that story will live longer than any name.
