Love is not a debt.

Children do not owe their parents a relationship just because they were born.  
What they owe—if anything—is shaped by presence, safety, and care.  
Not biology. Not tradition. Not guilt.

A parent may give life, but that doesn’t guarantee access to the child’s inner world.  
Especially if that parent caused deep emotional harm, denied their wrongdoing, or refused to grow.

Still, society tells us the opposite.  
We’re taught that cutting contact is cruel.  
That walking away is betrayal.  
That parents are sacred—no matter what they’ve done.

But the truth is:  
**Children have the right to protect their nervous systems.**  
They have the right to say: “This hurts me.”  
They have the right to choose peace over performance.

Relationships require consent.  
Even in families.

Rebuilding generational bridges doesn’t mean forcing connection where there’s no safety.  
It means honoring the truth—however painful.  
It means creating space for repair—but never demanding it.

Estrangement isn’t always the problem.  
Sometimes, it’s the only way a new cycle can begin.

A cycle rooted not in duty, but in **dignity**.

And from there, maybe—someday—something honest can grow.
