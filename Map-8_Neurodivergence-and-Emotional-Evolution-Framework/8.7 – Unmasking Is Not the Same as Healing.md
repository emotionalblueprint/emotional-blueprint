_Why showing yourself is not always the same as feeling safe._

---

In the neurodivergent community, unmasking is often celebrated as a path to liberation.
Removing the roles we had to perform—
the smiles, the tone of voice, the careful control of our reactions—
can feel like finally taking a breath after years underwater.

But there’s something important to name:
**Unmasking is not the same as healing.**

You can stop pretending.
You can speak your truth.
You can express your emotions—
and still feel just as unsafe, just as exhausted, just as alone.

Because healing isn’t just about removing the mask.
It’s about rebuilding the nervous system.
It’s about feeling safe in your body, in your relationships, in the world.

True healing means:
- You don’t collapse every time you’re misunderstood.
- You don’t panic when someone sets a boundary.
- You don’t feel the need to defend your worth at every moment.

Healing is about regulation, not just expression.
It’s about finding places where your body can rest—
and people who don’t just let you be yourself, but know how to meet you there.

So yes—unmasking can be powerful.
But if we stop there, we risk confusing vulnerability with healing.

Unmasking is a door.
Healing is what happens once you step through it—and start building something real on the other side.
