# The Cost of Being Good  
*How femininity was tied to silence, self-sacrifice, and emotional labor*

## The Performance of ‚ÄúGoodness‚Äù

For many, especially women and girls,  
the path to survival wasn‚Äôt through dominance‚Äî  
but through **disappearance**.

We were taught to be good.  
To be pleasing.  
To smile when it hurt.  
To carry the emotions of others without complaint.

To not upset.  
To not take up space.  
To not say: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt love.‚Äù

## What ‚ÄúGood‚Äù Really Meant

Being good often meant being **quiet**.  
Being agreeable.  
Being helpful even when it cost us our health.

It meant being the **emotional regulator** in the family.  
The peacekeeper.  
The one who made things okay for everyone else.

But this wasn't care.  
It was **survival**.

## Emotional Labor Disguised as Love

We were praised for:
- Soothing everyone else‚Äôs pain  
- Sensing tension before it exploded  
- Being strong in silence  
- Forgiving harm without repair

We were told this made us loving.  
Empathetic.  
Kind.  
But no one asked how it felt.

No one asked if we were okay.

## The Cost

The cost of being good was losing access to your **own truth**.

- Your anger became shame.  
- Your needs became guilt.  
- Your no became selfish.  
- Your voice became dangerous.

And yet‚Äîthis performance kept you safe.  
Until it didn‚Äôt.

## This Isn‚Äôt Just About Women

Many men, queer folks, neurodivergent people, and anyone raised to stay small  
have lived this same script.

The script of **compliance as survival**.  
The pressure to be lovable instead of real.  
The expectation to disappear gracefully.

## What This Page Offers

This page is a mirror‚Äî  
for anyone who learned that ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù meant **not disturbing others**  
even while being disturbed inside.

It asks:

- Who taught you that care means compliance?  
- Who benefitted from your silence?  
- What would change if you believed that *your needs are not a burden*?

You don‚Äôt have to keep being ‚Äúgood‚Äù to stay safe.

You are allowed to be **honest**,  
**angry**,  
**complicated**,  
**loud**,  
**whole**.

You don‚Äôt need to perform goodness anymore.

You get to be **real**.
