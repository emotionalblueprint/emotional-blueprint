## **The First Love Must Be Ours**  
_How patriarchy rewired our need for love—and how to return it to ourselves_

---

### 1. The Spell We Grew Up Under

We weren’t taught to love ourselves.  
We were taught to perform—to be what others wanted.  
To win love. Earn it. Deserve it.  
But that’s not love. That’s obedience.

---

### 2. Two Roads, Same Trap

- **Women** were told to be desirable—to be chosen  
- **Men** were told to be strong—to be respected  

Different scripts, same emptiness.  
A hunger for love that never truly sees us.

---

### 3. Real Love Doesn’t Come From Above

You don’t need to be loved _by them_ to be worthy.  
You need to be loved _by you_.  
Because no external love can fill the hole created by self-abandonment.

---

### 4. Breaking the Mirror

The first act of rebellion is to stop asking:  
> “Do they love me?”  
And start asking:  
> “Do I love me—even when no one else claps?”

---

### 5. The Way Back

Self-love isn’t a feeling.  
It’s a practice of **protection**, **kindness**, and **truth**.  
It’s looking in the mirror and not flinching.

It’s saying:  
> “I will not betray myself again just to be allowed in.”

---

### From Self-Love to Human Love

When love begins within, it naturally flows outward.  
Not as sacrifice. Not as control.  
But as care. Protection. Shared truth.

That’s how we build real community:

- Where no one has to beg for worth  
- Where no one needs to dominate to be seen  
- Where love isn’t a prize, but a way of being  

This is what patriarchy erased:  
That love is strongest **when it begins at home—inside us.**
