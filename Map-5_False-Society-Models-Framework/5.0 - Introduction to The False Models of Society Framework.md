# 🏛️ The False Models of Society Framework  
*How our emotional compass is distorted by the systems we live in*

---

Somewhere along the way, we started believing the lie:  
That power equals safety.  
That performance equals worth.  
That love must be earned.

This map helps you name the invisible rules that shaped your emotional survival.  
It shows how society teaches us to perform instead of feel—  
to suppress empathy in exchange for approval, control, or success.
