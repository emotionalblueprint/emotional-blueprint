## The Red Flags Recognition Tool  
*Learn to spot emotional control before it becomes abuse*

---

### What This Tool Does  
Emotional abuse rarely starts with obvious harm.  
It begins with small signals—confusion, discomfort, contradiction.

This tool helps you **spot the early patterns** of emotional control—  
so you can act before the damage deepens.

---

### 🔴 COMMON RED FLAGS
These are behaviors that may seem small—but often point to larger patterns.

- **They dismiss your feelings** (“You’re too sensitive.”)  
- **They shift blame quickly** (“It’s not my fault, you made me do it.”)  
- **They punish you emotionally** when you say no  
- **They constantly question your memory** (“That’s not what happened.”)  
- **They withdraw affection as punishment**  
- **They control small things**—then say you’re overreacting  
- **They turn your honesty into a guilt trip**  
- **They love-bomb, then disappear**  
- **They act like a victim when called out**

One red flag is a signal.  
Multiple red flags are a system.

### 🧭 How to Use This Tool
Use it to reflect:

- Do I feel safe being fully honest around them?  
- Do they take responsibility—or turn things around on me?  
- Do I leave conversations feeling confused or guilty?

These signs are not proof of abuse—  
but they’re **early warning signs** of emotional manipulation.

### 🧠 Notes for Neurodivergent Folks
You may have learned to override your internal alarms  
just to stay connected, safe, or accepted.

This tool helps you trust your nervous system again.  
It’s okay to leave a situation just because it doesn’t feel right.

You don’t have to wait until it becomes “bad enough.”

### 💛 Final Words
Red flags aren’t always obvious.  
But your body often knows before your mind can explain it.

This tool isn’t here to make you paranoid.  
It’s here to help you stay awake.

The sooner you name the pattern,  
the sooner you can walk away—or set a boundary that protects your peace.
