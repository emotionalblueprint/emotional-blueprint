## Manipulation Unmasked  
*An interactive tool to spot emotional control—one tactic at a time*

---

### Why This Tool Was Made  
Manipulation is often invisible at first.  
It hides in tone, timing, half-truths, and silence.

This tool helps you **recognize emotional control** through specific tactics—  
so you can name what’s happening as it happens.

Not to judge. Not to attack.  
But to reclaim your clarity.

### 🎭 COMMON MANIPULATION TACTICS
Each tactic may appear harmless alone—  
but together, they form a system of control.

#### 1. **Gaslighting**  
You’re made to doubt your memory, perception, or emotional reactions.  
*“That never happened.” “You’re being dramatic.”*

#### 2. **Guilt-tripping**  
They twist your needs into burdens.  
*“After all I’ve done for you…”*

#### 3. **Blame-shifting**  
They hurt you—then accuse you of overreacting.  
*“If you weren’t so sensitive, I wouldn’t have said that.”*

#### 4. **Love-bombing**  
Over-the-top affection to pull you in—followed by distance or control.  
*“No one will ever love you like I do.”*

#### 5. **Silent treatment**  
Used not to cool down—but to punish or control.  
You’re left scrambling for repair.

#### 6. **Rewriting the story**  
They change what happened to make themselves the victim—or the hero.  
Your experience gets erased.

#### 7. **Selective empathy**  
They show care when it benefits them—but vanish when you need real support.

#### 8. **Mocking vulnerability**  
They use what you shared against you—or make you feel foolish for needing care.
