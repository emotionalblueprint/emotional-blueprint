# 🧰 Overview – The Toolset Library  
_A collection of emotional tools to help you understand, regulate, and reconnect._

---

## 📚 What Is the Toolset Library?

The Toolset Library is where all the **practical tools** of The Emotional Blueprint live.

These tools don’t diagnose or label you.  
They help you **recognize patterns, shift modes, and come back to yourself**.

Each tool is visual, reflective, and neurodivergent-friendly—  
built to support emotional clarity, self-awareness, and healing.

They’re not abstract theories.  
They’re ways to actually *use* the framework in daily life.

## 🪑 A Place to Rest and Reflect

The Toolset Library is like a **bookshelf in the Blueprint library**:  
Each tool is a book you can pick up when you’re ready.  
You don’t have to read everything at once.  
You can start with the tool that meets you where you are.

---

> **These tools are here to help you listen to yourself more clearly—  
not to become someone else.**

When you use them gently, they become allies.  
Ways to shift from survival… back to connection.
