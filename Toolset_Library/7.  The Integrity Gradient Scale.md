## The Integrity Gradient Scale
*When someone's values sound rightâ€”but their actions donâ€™t match*

---

### What This Tool Reveals  
Many people say the right things: empathy, kindness, growth, love.

But words donâ€™t always align with patterns.  
This tool helps you see when someoneâ€™s **claimed values**  
are not showing up in their actual behavior.

Not to shame. But to protect your clarity.

### â†“â†“ VALUE ALIGNMENT â†“â†“  
**When behavior and belief match**

This is integrity. Even when itâ€™s hard.

**What it looks like:**
- Practices what they preachâ€”even when no oneâ€™s watching
- Admits mistakes and makes amends
- Stays kind and accountable in conflict
- Lives their values through everyday choices

You donâ€™t have to guess who they are.  
Their actions speak clearly.

### â†“â†“ CONDITIONAL ALIGNMENT â†“â†“  
**When values show up only when itâ€™s easy**

Here, the values are realâ€”but fragile.

**What it looks like:**
- Talks about empathyâ€”but disappears when you need care
- Values honestyâ€”but hides truths that make them uncomfortable
- Apologizesâ€”then repeats the same patterns
- Wants to growâ€”but resists feedback

This isnâ€™t evil.  
Itâ€™s emotional immaturity.

But if left unchecked, it becomes confusion and harm.

### â†“â†“ MANIPULATIVE ALIGNMENT â†“â†“  
**When values are used as a mask**

This is when someone weaponizes emotional language  
to appear goodâ€”while avoiding real accountability.

**What it looks like:**
- Uses healing language to shut down your pain
- Quotes values in publicâ€”but violates them in private
- Projects blame while performing vulnerability
- Claims growth while punishing you for speaking up

This is **emotional dishonesty**â€”with consequences.

### ðŸ§­ How to Use This Tool
Ask:
- Do their actions consistently reflect their words?  
- Do they show integrity *under pressure*â€”or just when itâ€™s easy?  
- Are their values a compassâ€”or a costume?

You donâ€™t have to argue with words.  
Just watch what they do.

### ðŸ§  Notes for Neurodivergent Folks
You may take words at face value, especially if you crave honesty and clarity.
This tool is here to help you hold both:
- What they say
- What they show

Behavior is the real belief system.

---

### ðŸ’› Final Words
True values donâ€™t disappear under pressure.  
They *reveal themselves* in it.

Let this tool remind you:
You deserve to be around people whose love, empathy, and care  
arenâ€™t just spokenâ€”but **lived.**
