## The Emotional Maturity Snapshot  
*A simple tool to assess intent, growth, and emotional safety*

---

### Why This Tool Exists  
Sometimes you feel it—but don’t know how to name it.
The emotional gap between you and someone else.  
The sense that something’s missing.

This tool offers **3 reflection questions**  
to help you understand someone’s emotional maturity—  
and whether it’s safe to stay close.

---

### 🔍 1. DO THEY SEE THEMSELVES CLEARLY?  
**Self-awareness is the first sign of emotional growth.**

What to look for:
- They can name their flaws without shame or defense
- They recognize their own patterns over time
- They don’t always need to be right

If someone refuses to look inward,  
you’ll always be the mirror they want to break.

### 🔍 2. DO THEY USE THEIR EMOTIONAL INSIGHT TO BUILD OR TO CONTROL?  
**Emotional intelligence can heal—or manipulate.**

What to look for:
- Do they use empathy to connect—or to guilt?  
- Do they calm situations—or steer them to keep power?  
- Do they understand feelings—but ignore your boundaries?

The more someone knows about emotions,  
the more important it is to ask:  
**What are they doing with that knowledge?**

### 🔍 3. DO THEY GROW AFTER THEY HURT YOU?  
**Remorse isn’t just a feeling—it’s a pattern.**

What to look for:
- They take responsibility without being cornered
- They repair without making it about them
- They change behavior—not just language

Mature people grow from conflict.  
Immature ones rewrite it.

### 🧭 How to Use This Tool
Use this snapshot when you’re:
- Unsure whether someone is safe to open up to
- Feeling guilty for needing distance
- Questioning whether you're asking for too much

This is not a diagnostic.  
It’s a flashlight.

You’re not demanding too much.  
You’re asking for emotional safety.

It’s here to protect your peace.

**Emotional maturity isn’t about perfection.**
