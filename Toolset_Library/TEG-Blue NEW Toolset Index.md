#  TEG-Blue Toolset Index  
*A full list of emotional tools included in The Emotional Gradient Blueprint*

---
#  Welcome to the Toolset Layer  
*Practical emotional maps for healing, clarity, and inner direction*

---

This section is not theoretical.  
It’s for when your heart is confused.  
Your boundaries feel blurry.  
Or you need something simple to help you understand what’s happening.

Each tool in this layer was created to bring emotional complexity down to earth—  
not by oversimplifying it, but by **making it visible**.

You’ll find **Gradient Scales**, **Reflection Tools**, and **Emotional Maps** that show you:

- How survival patterns become emotional harm  
- Where you are on your healing path  
- What emotional safety actually looks and feels like  
- And how to recognize when a relationship—or belief—is no longer serving you

You don’t need to use these tools in order.  
You don’t even need to “finish” them.

Let your nervous system guide you.  
Pick what speaks to you.  
Come back when you’re ready.

This is a place to **make sense of what felt unspeakable.**  
A place to find your voice again.
