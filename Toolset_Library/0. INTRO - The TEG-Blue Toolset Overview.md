## **The TEG-Blue Toolset Overview**

  

_A library of emotional tools to help you see what was once invisible_

---

Inside TEG-Blue, you wonâ€™t just find theoryâ€”youâ€™ll find tools.

  

These tools were designed to help you:

- Name what happened to you
    
- Understand what you feel
    
- Recognize patterns of harm or healing
    
- Rebuild your emotional compass
    
- Learn the difference between real care and disguised control
    

  

Each one is a reflection of the framework it belongs to.

Together, they create a powerful set of **emotional maps** you can return to anytime.

  

These tools are built with:

  

âœ” **Neurodivergent minds** in mind

âœ” **Real-life emotional language**

âœ” **Structured gradients** that make patterns easier to track

âœ” **Validation** for the pain that others tried to minimize or explain away

### **ðŸ”§ How the Toolset Works**

  

The Tool Library is divided into three types:

1. **Gradient Scales** â€“ Tools that map emotional and behavioral shifts across a spectrum
    
2. **Clarifier Tools** â€“ Quick-reflection pages to check for safety, truth, or manipulation
    
3. **Games & Interactive Tools** â€“ Practice naming red flags, green flags, and emotional tactics
    

  

Each tool includes:

- A plain-language description
    
- Emotional context (Why this tool matters)
    
- Key patterns or phrases to look for
    
- Notes for neurodivergent users
    
- A closing truth to carry forward

### **ðŸ§­ When to Use the Tools**

  

These are not assessments.

Theyâ€™re not quizzes.

Theyâ€™re not tests.

  

Theyâ€™re **companions**â€”meant to help you see more clearly when youâ€™re:

- Doubting yourself
    
- Confused in a relationship
    
- Healing from emotional harm
    
- Trying to explain your experience
    
- Learning to trust your perception again
    

  

You donâ€™t need permission to use them.

You donâ€™t need a crisis to justify them.

  

They are here **for your clarity**, and that is enough.
